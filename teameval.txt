		Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #2

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.

(1) List the names of your team members:

A:  Chihao Yu

 
B:  Luyi Li

 
 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 	       B
meetings 	  	  	2                   2
coding 	  	  	        8             10
writeup 	  	  	7                   5
planning (alone) 	  	3  	            3
total (including meetings) 	20  	  	20


(3) Describe 
  (a) what the major responsibilities of each team member were;
Chihao Yu: implementing shared memory matrix multiplication solutions and add the edge case solution to all the implementation. 
Luyi Li: implement 2D tiling for the matrix multiplication, and other optimizations including loop unrolling, branch elimination and register use.
  (b) whether or not you completed the assignment;
Yes
  (c) the major strengths and weaknesses in your team, e.g. how
      your team worked together;
Chihao Yu: strength:always eager to learn, weakness: took me some time to understand whole idea
  (d) the lessons learned from these events;
Chihao Yu: how to load elements more from register and less from shared memory and less from main memory.
Luyi Li: basic usage of low-level cuda programming
  (e) whether and how you plan to change the way your work together and
Chihao Yu:I think overall we did really well, really good team
Luyi Li: Good teamwork!
  (f) anything else that comes to mind.
No
